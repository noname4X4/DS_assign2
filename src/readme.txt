trying to break whole program into small parts
write functions separately to make sure they can work
now achieved:
server and client connect through socket
read txt file and transfer to json format
create entity for weather data
verify data(the invalid data miss two strings:local_date_time:15/04:00pm
                                              local_date_time_full:20230715160000)
